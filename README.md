# House Price Prediction Using Regression Models

## Summary
This project focuses on predicting exact housing prices using regression models for a real estate consultancy. Building on the previous phase, where we classified houses as "Expensive" or "Not Expensive," this phase aims to predict specific house prices. Key regression metrics like R² Score and RMSE were used to evaluate model accuracy.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for regression models and cross-validation)
- **Pandas**, **Numpy**

## Key Learnings
- Enhanced understanding of regression modeling, particularly in handling continuous target variables.
- Gained practical experience with feature selection and transformation techniques to optimize model performance.
- Learned to interpret key regression metrics (R² Score and RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy.

## Challenges Overcame
- Processed a dataset of 1,500 houses and over 80 features, requiring thorough data cleaning and transformation.
- Experimented with different regression algorithms to identify the best model, followed by iterative tuning and evaluation.

## Additional Reflections
Future analysis could benefit from additional feature selection techniques and experimenting with new regression models to further refine prediction accuracy.
